# get the list of rentals
# iterate through that list

# calculate rental days

# look up price per day for car
# conditionals:
# 1: if rental_days <= 1, get price_per_day
# 2: if rental_days > 1 && < 4, get price_per_day with 10% discount
# 3: if rental_days > 4 && < 10, get price_per_day with 30% discount
# 4: if rental_days > 10, get price_per_day with 50% discount
# multiply by price per day

# look up price per km
# multiply price per km by distance
# get total price by adding time and distance components
# return a hash with a key "rentals" which is an array of hashes with id and total price
# print this out in output-backend.json file
